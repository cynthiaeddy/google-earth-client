# Earth Paints

Earth Paints is an app to discover images that Google Earth has taken. It amazes me that the earth from afar resembles what artists emotionally strive to emulate. Incorporates a search bar where users can search by Country with the caveat they aren't all represented.



This App has two Github Repositories. This one is for the React frontend. The other one is for the Rails API backend (link below in instructions).

## Instructions
To run this app:

PART ONE

Go to https://github.com/cynthiaeddy/google-earh-api and follow the instructions to run the Earth Paints backend. Then return here.

PART TWO

Clone this repo.

Run npm install and npm start. You will be asked if you would like to run the program on another server. Type "Y" for Yes.

Your browser will automatically launch the Earth Paints app to its home page.

You can shut down both servers by typing Control C in the terminal window where they are running.
